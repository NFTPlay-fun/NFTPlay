## Project Profile：

NFTPlay - We're innovatively building bridges between the virtual and the real, creating a fun and easy connection between Web2 and Web3. We have three key products at present: GEN1-「NFT display frame」, GEN2-「NFT & NFC」, and GEN3-「Web3 user loyalty platform」.

Our ambition is to utilize hardware and software technologies to enrich the presentation, interaction, and marketing scenarios of blockchain and Web3 applications in the real world. We aim to help brands, IPs, and organizations build new customer relationships and enhancing user engagement and brand loyalty.
